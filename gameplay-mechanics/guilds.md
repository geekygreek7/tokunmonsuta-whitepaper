# Guilds

**Guilds** are a great option for players looking to expand their gaming community and enhance their experience in **Tokun Monsuta**. With social features such as _Guild Chat_ and _Guild Forums_, players can communicate with fellow guild-mates wherever they are in the world.

To create a guild, a minimum of 10 players must sign a Guild Ledger and pay a fee of <mark style="color:orange;">Tokun</mark>. The position of _**Guild Lead**_ will automatically default to the ledger holder, who will have the authority to add and remove members from the Guild. It is important to pick someone you trust to be the ledger holder as he or she can only be removed by a 60% majority vote from the guild. Guild leaders will be able to post and recruit members for their guild within our social ecosystem.

### **Guild Perks**

Belonging to a Guild can play a vital role in earning additional perks which can either be passive or active.
