# Abilities (Files)

![](../.gitbook/assets/real-files.png)

### **What are \[Files]?**

`[Files]` were initially created by the developers at **MetaToys Inc**. to endow _Token Monsters_ with powerful buffs and skills to boost them in combat. As our story unfolds, new file-types are introduced to assist players in challenging Dungeons, embarking on quests or flexing new cosmetic rewards.

`[Files]` are organized into four main categories: **Upgrades, Repairs, Power-ups** and **Viruses**. You can also obtain Cosmetic `[Files]` which are used outside of battle and are always active. Players will hold all their `[Files]` in a personal _<mark style="color:blue;">**Hard Drive**</mark>_ which will act as an ability index, allowing players to add or remove `[Files]` from their action bar.

### **\[File] Rarities**

All `[Files]` can come in four rarities types; <mark style="color:green;">**Uncommon**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**Rare**</mark>, <mark style="color:purple;">**Epic**</mark>, and <mark style="color:orange;">**Legendary**</mark>. Rarer `[Files]` will be more valuable to the player base as they will either provide greater utility or will represent harder to obtain cosmetics.

### **Using \[Files] in Battle**

Players will choose from among the `[Files]` within their _<mark style="color:blue;">**Hard Drive**</mark>_ (_ability index_) to upload a maximum of five files from each category of abilities onto their action bar. The effects of `[Files]` can be combined to create more powerful attacks, such as using one file to boost the damage of another. In addition to using `[Files]` offensively, players can also use `[Files]` defensively to protect their monster or counter enemy attacks.

_**Note:**_ Some ability Files will be extremely powerful when combined with other types. We are counting on the community to create undiscovered meta-plays and combos!
