# Arena Battle System (PvP)

### **Entering the Arena**

The Arena allows players to showcase their connection to <mark style="color:green;">**Denshi**</mark> and their skill in commanding their monsters in battle. Players are matched via a _**Matchmaking Rating**_ (MMR) system. Each victory allows you to climb to higher brackets of competition. Victories in the Arena will reward you with <mark style="color:orange;">Tokun</mark> and a chance to earn Arena-specific `Files`.

### **PvP Leaderboards**

At the end of each arena season, players are ranked by their win/loss ratio and their creatures and usernames will appear on our _**PVP Leaderboard**_. The top bracket of players each season will receive unique and valuable cosmetics to use or sell on the _real-money_ **Marketplace**.
