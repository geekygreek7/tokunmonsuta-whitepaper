**DAO Governance / Utility** - <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> will serve as both a DAO token and a utility token for <mark style="color:blue;">**Tokun Monsuta**</mark>. The total allotment will be capped at **5,000,000**. <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> will provide voting rights to all holders as well as access to exclusive in-game items.

**Dungeon Staking** - Investors who purchase Dungeons will be able to stake them to earn <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark>. Dungeons will be available for purchase prior to the game launching. Dungeons can lock their staking position monthly or yearly. Dungeon owners who lock in their stake for the full year will have the opportunity to earn 2x <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark>. In addition to generating <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark>, Dungeons will also generate <mark style="color:orange;">`Tokun`</mark>, our in-game currency.&#x20;

**Monster Staking** - Players and investors will have the opportunity to stake NFT monsters to earn <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark>. This period marks the largest earning potential of <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> for players via staking, as staking slots will reduce significantly once the game has launched; providing only 3 staking slots per Dungeon.

**Team** - The leadership team will receive 20% of the total allotment of <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code,`</mark> locked for a period of two years, followed by monthly disbursements over the following year.&#x20;

**Treasury** - `Heptagon Gaming` will institute a locked Liquidity Pool which will offer the community a further **20%** of the total pool of <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark>.

**In-Game Rewards** - It's important for the team that gameplay be a cornerstone in the allotment of <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark>. To accomplish this, we have locked the final 20% of <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> behind in-game rewards. These rewards are unlocked through in-game activities such as Dungeon and monster staking and placing in the top bracket of the leaderboards. The rate at which the final pool of <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> is unlocked will depend on the activity of our player base. We anticipate unlocking to occur within a three year period after the game is launched.
