# $Code

### **What is&#x20;**<mark style="color:purple;">**`$Code`**</mark>**?**

<mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> is the metadata of <mark style="color:green;">Denshi</mark>, broken down into its purest form and reassembled as commands to create new technology. <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> is another (harder to obtain) currency in **Tokun Monsuta**, obtained through staking and successfully completing in-game content. <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> will represent Tokun Monsuta’s _DAO / Utility token_ and will be capped at **5,000,000**.
