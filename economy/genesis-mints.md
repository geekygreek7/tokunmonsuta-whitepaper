# Genesis Mints

**When is your NFT sale? Are you doing a Whitelist?**\
We are aiming to launch mint in early Summer. We will be releasing a limited Whitelist of 5,000 1st-edition monsters, followed by a semi-limited discord-only whitelist of 10,000 2nd-edition monsters and finally a full release of the final 15,000 2nd-edition monsters to our public mint.

**What is the NFT?**\
The NFT is your own personal Denshi monster, which will be animated in 3D within our game. Every one of our 30,000 different Genesis monsters will be entirely unique both in their NFT and within the game. Players will use their monsters to battle, explore and advance through the game.

**Benefits for 1st edition holders:**

* Staking early to earn <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> and <mark style="color:orange;">`Tokun`</mark>. All <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> holders will have early voting rights for early development decisions.
* **1st Edition** (_1-Star_) holders (_5,000 total_) will get airdropped _2nd edition_ (_2-star_) monsters which they can choose to keep and use in-game or sell to another player. This provides them with the opportunity to grow the player base.
* **1st Edition** (1-Star) holders have the best odds of generating the rarest monsters as their pool will number only **5,000**. This is as opposed to the full probability of **88.4 million unique monsters** that will either be captured or killed throughout the lifespan of the game.
* _Upon release of the game demo_, players with **1st edition** monsters will be airdropped exclusive in-game items, such as cosmetics and mounts. These will be NFTs and they will be sellable on our Marketplace.
* **1st Edition** (1-Star) holders will have beta access to our demo. This will give them an edge in learning the mechanics of the game. They will consequently have an advantage to earn more once the full game is released.&#x20;
