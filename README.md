![](.gitbook/assets/FINAL.jpg)

<mark style="color:blue;">**Tokun Monsuta**</mark> is an action-adventure multiplayer online RPG game which fuses puzzle-platform gameplay with a live-action combat system. Unlike traditional games, Tokun Monsuta will make use of **blockchain technology** to allow players to own the digital assets they’ve earned in game. Players will utilize their unique monsters to team up and defeat Dungeons, explore story-driven quest lines and earn valuable loot to empower them along the way.&#x20;

Your adventure will begin alongside our young engineer, **Elliot**, who has discovered a vast and mysterious digital world called <mark style="color:green;">**Denshi**</mark>, inhabited by a species of diverse digital monsters. Each monster is uniquely tied to the very fabric of Denshi, and represents a powerful memory linked to the creators of this world. Elliot believes that the monsters are key to understanding the dark and twisted origins of Denshi, buried deep within its metadata; <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark>. He’s committed to understanding how <mark style="color:purple;">`$Code`</mark> works in order to harness its power and unlock limitless possibilities for humanity. As Elliot’s friend, you will journey to help him expose corrupt actors, defeat interactive player-owned dungeons and earn precious and powerful loot. As you explore an unfolding storyline, your experience and skill will help you to harness and wield your Denshi monster’s limitless potential.&#x20;
