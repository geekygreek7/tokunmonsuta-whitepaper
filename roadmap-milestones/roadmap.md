**Early Game Concept / Designs / Distribution of early Whitelist spots**

In early Q3 we began development of preliminary game concepts and designs in preparation for developing a gameplay prototype in _**Unreal Engine 5**_. The team will begin development of a teaser trailer alongside a fuller gameplay trailer showcasing the expected gameplay style and the character animations. Our wish is for players to anticipate their gaming experience and have a peek at the monsters coming to life.

During this time, _**5,000 Whitelist**_ spots for pre-minting 1st edition monsters will be distributed through various means, including but not limited to Twitter promotions, Discord events/contests and promotional giveaways during AMAâ€™s. 1st edition monster holders will reap benefits such as exclusive airdrops, early access to staking and early beta access.&#x20;
