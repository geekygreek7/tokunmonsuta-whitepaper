Son of a German father and Jewish mother, **Clint Berg** was son to two hard-working and frugal parents. Both his father and mother worked long hours and were seldom home. Growing up, Clint was obsessed with toys. While he didn’t own many, the few he owned were his most prized possessions.&#x20;

Clint's parents were prudent savers, believing that money was better saved than spent. They saw toys as nothing more than recycled garbage, meant to waste a child's time and energy. Still, on special occasions, such as birthdays and holidays, they would bring themselves to buy Clint something used. His birthday gifts were often damaged or heavily worn, but it didn’t matter to Clint. He saw only infinite possibilities for storytelling and adventure. When his toys inevitably began to fall apart from overuse, Clint had no recourse but to learn how to fix them himself. Over the years he became so adept at repairing his toys that he even began to make his own.

Clint, who was only in elementary school, brought his creations to class and his envious classmates would ask him where he got his new toys. Being clever and with an entrepreneurial spirit about him, Clint saw the situation as an opportunity to share the joy and fantasy that his toys inspired in him. He began to build toys for his classmates which he would barter for things he always wanted but his parents would never buy, like new sneakers or designer clothing. What began as a childhood bartering, persisted throughout his adolescent years when he would actually sell his toys and make enough money to buy himself the things his parents wouldn’t dream of getting him. As a young entrepreneur with a talent for toy making, he continued to design innovative toys all throughout high school, and even hired a few of his closest friends, teaching them how to make his toys, allowing him to quickly ramp up production.

After graduating high school at the age of 17, Clint went against the wishes of his parents, who had saved up all their meager earnings to support him in attending university to become a doctor. Instead, Clint used the money he made from his homegrown operation to open his own toy company. On his 18th birthday, <mark style="color:red;">**MetaToys Inc**</mark>. was established. Named after his bullish belief that he was a trend setter and knew the new meta of toys before anyone else, his company grew from humble beginnings to become a recognized brand. In time, MetaToys Inc. would come to create the most memorable and beloved toys of the era, many of which later became classics in the toy industry. Clint quickly became known for being on the cutting edge of industry as the head of one of the best-selling and most famous brands in the world.
