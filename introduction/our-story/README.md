Technology, with its promise of ever-growing convenience has been implemented at the cost of individual identity and the rampant manipulation of user behavior. Regional governments have been supplanted by a monopoly of Corporations, consolidated under a world-wide Technocracy. Bound and indebted to technology, manipulated and brainwashed to distrust reality, a young boy may have accidentally discovered the key to awakening humanityâ€™s consciousness.
