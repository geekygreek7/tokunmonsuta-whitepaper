# How to Leverage Blockchain for Gaming?

The core philosophy behind <mark style="color:blue;">**Tokun Monsuta**</mark> is to create a game that people will love playing for many years to come. As founders, we are inspired by the memories of our childhood, the endless hours spent lost in the wonder and joy of gaming. Our dream is to bring this unique and thrilling experience back to gaming in a way that feels both familiar and fresh.

Every game element within Tokun Monsuta is developed with the intention of rewarding players for their time and skill, and **blockchain technology** (BT) allows us to expand these rewards. One of the greatest opportunities we see with BT is the ability to provide players with greater influence over the games they love to play as well as full autonomy over their in-game items. Tokun Monsuta operates within a player-owned economy, requiring for nearly every item in our games market to be first unlocked through gameplay. This model provides players with full control over the supply and demand of in-game items being sold on the marketplace. As players progress through the game they will earn increasingly more powerful and valuable items which they can then choose to use as they wish. Players who arenâ€™t interested in leveraging blockchain technology can choose to sell their items within our in-game market for <mark style="color:orange;">Tokun</mark> (_our in-game currency_), providing them with the experience they are most comfortable and happy with. Players wishing to leverage the additional value the blockchain can offer will have the option to sell their earned items on our _real-money_ Marketplace.

In-game items will include but are not limited to: Monsters, Files, and Cosmetics. Monsters can be caught by players in-game using empty consoles. `[Files]`, such as **Upgrades**, **Repairs**, **Power**-**ups**, and **Viruses** will serve as skills which can be taught to your monster to aid them in battle. Finally, Cosmetics will provide quality-of-life enhancements or can be used to flex your achievements in game.
